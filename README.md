# replicon
CLI tool to resize and export SVG logo to PNG files with different sizes and magnifications.

```
node dist\index.min.js
No logo file specified. Would you like to use 'ugh.svg' as the logo? (yes/no): yes
Exported icon16.png
Exported icon16@2x.png
Exported icon32.png
Exported icon32@2x.png
Exported icon48.png
Exported icon48@2x.png
Exported icon128.png
Exported icon128@2x.png
All PNG files exported successfully
```

Because I got tired of manually replicating (resize, export, repeat) icons using Inkscape and/or Gimp!
